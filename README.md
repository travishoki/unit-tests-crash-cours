3. Jest Tests
   `yarn test`
4. Press `p` to filter by a filename regex pattern
5. Begin typing the component name: `src/1`
6. Arrow down to the section "Pattern matches 1 file", hit enter on the desired file

## Package Links:

## Jest

Delightful JavaScript Testing

## Jest - Expect

https://jestjs.io/docs/expect
When you're writing tests, you often need to check that values meet certain conditions. expect gives you access to a number of "matchers" that let you validate different things.

### Sinon:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon
Standalone and test framework agnostic JavaScript test spies, stubs and mocks

| File       | % Stmts   | % Branch   | % Funcs   | % Lines   | Uncovered Line #s   |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| All files  | 0         | 0          | 0         | 0         |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------- |

- **Stmts**: instructions that have been executed at least once during the unit tests. For example, we can have a line that contains two statements: `var age= 18; console.log(age)` this contains a variable declaration statement and a statement that executes the log function that belongs to the console object.
- **Branch**: if statements which conditions have been fulfilled at least once during the unit tests.
- **Funcs**: functions that have been called at least once during the unit tests.
- **Lines**: code lines that have executed at least once during the unit tests.
